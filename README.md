Positioning divs as I like. Concepts of positioning revised.

```css
.qr {
  width: 300px;
  height: 475px;
  background-color: white;
  margin-left: 528.5px;
  margin-top: 75px;
  border-radius: 25px;
  justify-content: center;
}
.qr-pic {
  position: relative;
  margin-top: 25px;
  border-radius: 25px;
  margin-left: 25px;
  height: 250px;
  width: 250px;
}
```

### Continued development
